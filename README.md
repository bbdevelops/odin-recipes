Feline Flavor Files

Welcome to the ultimate digital cookbook where the recipes are legendary and the chefs have whiskers. This project features a collection of high-calorie, highly opinionated HTML recipe pages narrated by the internet’s (and cinema's) most iconic cats.
Current Menu

    Garfield’s Delight: A structural masterpiece of cheese and pasta. No Mondays allowed.

    Salem’s "World Domination" Pancakes: Fluffy flapjacks with a side of dry wit and global ambition.

    Puss in Boots’ "Legendary" Gazpacho: A vibrant, sword-sharp soup that demands respect (and maybe a tiny hat).

Setup

    Clone the repo.

    Open index.html to browse the collection.

    Keep your fingers away from the keyboard if you're eating—cats don't like sticky keys.

“I’m not messy, I’m just an artist with meat sauce.” — Garfield (probably)
