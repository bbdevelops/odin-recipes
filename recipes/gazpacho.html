    <h2>The Sword-Sharp Gazpacho of San Ricardo</h2>
        <p>
        Pray for mercy, for you are about to taste the most vibrant, most daring soup in all of Spain! This is not your grandmother’s lukewarm vegetable water; this is Gazpacho—a dish as bold as my cape and as cool as my gaze. It is a liquid symphony of sun-ripened tomatoes and sharp vinegar that dances upon the tongue like a duelist in the night. One sip, and you will understand why they call me the "Leche-Lover"—though, between us, a cat of my stature requires something with a bit more... *zest* to keep the whiskers sharp.
        </p>
        <p>
        To make a gazpacho worthy of a legend, one must respect the ingredients. They must be fresh, they must be colorful, and they must be blended with the passion of a thousand flamenco dancers. It is a dish served cold, much like the justice I deal to those who dare touch my hat. Whether you are recovering from a battle with a giant or simply looking to impress a beautiful senorita, this soup is your secret weapon. Now, put down the sword and pick up the blender!
        </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs very ripe Roma tomatoes (redder than my boots).</li>
            <li>1 small cucumber, peeled and seeded (for the "cool").</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper (the snap of the whip).</li>
            <li>1/2 small red onion (sharp, like my claws).</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic (to keep the vampires—and dogs—away).</li>
            <li>3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil (the smooth finish).</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sherry vinegar (for the bite of a hero).</li>
            <li>A pinch of cumin and salt (the spice of life).</li>
            <li>A slice of crusty bread, soaked in water (the secret for texture).</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The Preparation: Rough chop the tomatoes, cucumber, pepper, onion, and garlic. Do it with flair, but watch your fingers—I am the only one allowed to be "handless" in a legend.</li>
        <li>The Softening: Squeeze the water out of your soaked bread. This adds a creaminess that will make you purr.</li>
        <li>The Whirlwind: Throw everything into a blender. Tomatoes, veg, bread, vinegar, and spices. Blend until it is as smooth as my velvet purr.</li>
        <li>The Emulsion: While blending on low, slowly stream in the olive oil. This is the "magic" that makes it shine like a freshly polished rapier.</li>
        <li>The Chill: Pour the mixture into a glass carafe and hide it in the refrigerator for at least two hours. Patience is a virtue, though I admit, it is not one of *my* virtues.</li>
        <li>The Garnish: Pour into a chilled bowl. Top with a drizzle of oil and perhaps a tiny crouton.</li>
        <li>The Toast: Raise your spoon and shout "Viva Gazpacho!" before consuming with gusto.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Pro Tip</h3>
        <p>If the soup is too thick, add a splash of water. If your life is too boring, add a pair of tiny leather boots. Both work wonders.</p>
