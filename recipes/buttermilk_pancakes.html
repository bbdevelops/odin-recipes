    <h2>Salem’s "I Was a Warlock" Flapjacks</h2>
        <p>
        Look, when you’ve been sentenced to 100 years as a house cat for trying to take over the world, you learn to find joy in the little things. And by "little things," I mean giant, circular stacks of fluffy, golden-brown carbs. Pancakes are the only human invention that justifies the existence of a morning. They are soft, they are spongey, and unlike my attempts at global tyranny, they actually rise to the occasion. If they aren’t soaking in enough maple syrup to classify as a wetland, you’re just eating dry bread, and frankly, I expected more from you.

        The key here is the buttermilk. It provides that subtle tang that reminds me of my glory days in the Magic Realm, minus the lightning bolts. You want these to be thick enough to cushion a fall but light enough to float away if you don't anchor them down with a slab of butter. I’ve spent decades staring at these from the floor level; trust me, the view from the top of the stack is much better. Now, grab the whisk and let’s make something worth losing my dignity for.
        </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour (the dust of destiny).</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sugar (because I’m sweet, deep down).</li>
            <li>2 tsp baking powder & 1 tsp baking soda (for the "oomph").</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt (to match my personality).</li>
            <li>2 cups buttermilk (accept no substitutes).</li>
            <li>2 large eggs (beaten, like my dreams of conquest).</li>
            <li>4 tbsp melted butter (the liquid gold).</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract (optional, but I’m worth it).</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the Dry Stuff: Mix flour, sugar, powder, soda, and salt. Imagine you’re mixing a potion to turn your enemies into newts.</li>
        <li>The Wet Work: In a separate bowl, whisk the buttermilk, eggs, vanilla, and melted butter. Try not to spill; I’m not cleaning it up.</li>
        <li>The Union: Pour the wet into the dry. Stir until *just* combined. Lumps are fine. Overmixing makes them tough, and I’m the only tough thing in this house.</li>
        <li>Heat the Griddle: Get a pan to medium heat. A drop of water should dance on it, much like I do when the vacuum is off.</li>
        <li>The Pour: Use a 1/4 cup measure to drop batter onto the pan. Wait for bubbles to form on the surface—that’s the pancake’s way of saying "I’m ready for my close-up."</li>
        <li>The Flip: Flip it once. Just once! Don't over-handle it; it’s a pancake, not a stress ball.</li>
        <li>The Stack: Layer them high. Higher. No, even higher.</li>
        <li>The Drown: Pour syrup until the plate is a lake and the pancakes are an island of deliciousness.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Pro Tip</h3>
        <p>If you want to feel like a real rebel, eat them at 2 AM while wearing a tiny crown. It really enhances the flavor of the rebellion.</p>
